# Turtle-Crossy-Road-Game
A simple game inspired by the classic "Frogger" and "Crossy Road" using Python's turtle module.

# Usage:
1) Run the main game script
2) Use the 'Up' arrow key on your keyboard to move the turtle up.
3) Try to reach the finish line (top of the screen) without getting hit by a car.
4) The game tracks the level you're on. Each level increases the speed of the cars.
5) The game ends if you get hit by a car.
